// var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];
// // console.log(shapes[0]);

// // //A for loop contains the following three important statements: The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.
// // //Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code:
// // //var x = 0;

// // //The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running.
// // //This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code:
// // x < shapes.length;

// // //â€¢	The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time.
// // //The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code:
// // x++

// for (var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
//     console.log(shapes[x]);
// }
